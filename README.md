<h1>What is a dashboard? A complete overview</h1>

<p>In this day and age, understanding data is the key to making the best decisions for any business. However, the amount of information that‚Äôs available at any time can be overwhelming for the most data-savvy person.</p>

<p>A dashboard is a way of displaying various types of visual data in one place. Usually, a dashboard is intended to convey different, but related information in an easy-to-digest form. And oftentimes, this includes things like key performance indicators (KPI)s or other important business metrics that stakeholders need to see and understand at a glance.

Dashboards are useful across different industries and verticals because they‚Äôre highly customizable. They can include data of all sorts with varying date ranges to help you understand: what happened, why it happened, what may happen, and what action you should take. And since dashboards use visualizations like [tables](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/reference-library/visual-analytics/tables), graphs, and [charts](https://www.tableau.com/data-insights/reference-library/visual-analytics/charts), others who aren‚Äôt as close to the data can quickly and easily understand the story it tells or the insights it reveals</p>
